## Installing macOS


Before we begin, it's important to know whether your Chromebook is even supported:
- ARM/AMD CPUs are not supported.
- Intel Celeron / Pentium CPUs are not supported.
- Tiger Lake (11th gen) CPUs and newer are not supported.
- You need at least 32GB of eMMC storage.

**You will also need:**
* Patience 
    * This is not a one click setup thing. It usually takes one or more weeks to have a stable hack.
* A USB drive 
  * 4 gigabytes or more for a online installer.
  * 32 gigabytes or more for offline installer.
* The ability to use a command prompt 
  * We won't help you if you don't know how to `cd` to a directory.

### Known Issues

- Broken NVRAM on Comet Lake Devices
   - To fix this, **DISABLE** `DevirtualiseMmio`.
   {: .warning}
   If your device has a Comet Lake CPU, this MUST be disabled.
    
   
- Waking from sleep causes:
   - Blank Electron / Chromium apps
   - Buggy video playback in web browsers like Firefox or Safari
   - Display/Wallpaper settings in SysPref/SysSettings
   - Logging out freezes your system

**Installing macOS**


**Getting Started:**

1. Follow the [Dortania guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide).
2. Follow the laptop guide for your CPU generation
   * Amber Lake Chromebooks should follow the Kaby Lake config.plist setup   


**Chromebook Specific Modifications**

1. [ChromebookPS2](https://github.com/meghan06/ChromebookPS2/): Remaps top row FX keys to their intended purpose for Chromebook keyboards
2. [croscorebootpatch](https://github.com/meghan06/croscorebootpatch): Fixes freeze on booting with coreboot 4.20 and up.
3. [crossdxcdisable](https://github.com/meghan06/crossdxcdisable): Disables SD card reader as it is unsupported.
4. [croshdasdisable](https://github.com/meghan06/croshdasdisable): Disables the `HDAS` device in ACPI as there is no support for it in macOS.

   {: .warning }
   croshdasdisable will break HDMI audio!
   
6. [EmeraldSDHC](https://github.com/acidanthera/EmeraldSDHC/releases): eMMC driver
7. Take those files you downloaded and put the `.aml` files in the ACPI folder, and the `.kexts` into the kexts folder
8. Snapshot (cmd +r) or (ctrl + r) your `config.plist`. 


{: .note }
`croshdasdisable` and `crossdxcdisable` disable unsupported devices in macOS, such as speakers. Disabling unsupported devices in macOS saves battery life and increases stability.

{: .warning }
If you dualboot with the SSDTs mentioned above, you might run into issues on other OSes. A `OSI_` check is not present in these SSDTs.
